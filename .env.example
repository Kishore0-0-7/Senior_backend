# ============================================================
# RENDER DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION FOR REACT NATIVE APP
# ============================================================
# When deploying to Render (free tier) for React Native mobile app:
#
# 1. Set BASE_URL to your Render backend URL (without trailing slash)
#    Example: BASE_URL=https://senior-backend.onrender.com
#
# 2. All file uploads (images, PDFs, documents) will be saved locally
#    in the backend's ./uploads directory with the following structure:
#    - ./uploads/attendance-photos/
#    - ./uploads/certificates/
#    - ./uploads/onduty-documents/
#    - ./uploads/onduty-selfies/
#    - ./uploads/profile-photos/
#
# 3. IMPORTANT: Render's free tier uses ephemeral storage
#    - Files will persist during runtime
#    - Files will be DELETED when the service restarts/redeploys
#    - Consider upgrading to a paid Render plan or using external
#      storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.) for production use
#
# 4. The application will automatically generate full URLs for all
#    uploaded files using the BASE_URL, ensuring proper access from
#    your React Native mobile application
#
# 5. Example Render environment variables:
#    NODE_ENV=production
#    PORT=3000
#    BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
#    DB_HOST=your-database-host.onrender.com
#    DB_PORT=5432
#    DB_NAME=your_database_name
#    DB_USER=your_db_user
#    DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
#    JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_secure_jwt_secret
#    CORS_ORIGIN=*
#
# 6. React Native Specific Notes:
#    - React Native doesn't have browser CORS restrictions
#    - Mobile apps can access files via full HTTP URLs
#    - Consider image compression for mobile data usage
#    - Test on both iOS and Android devices
#    - Handle network errors gracefully (offline mode)
#    - Use react-native-image-picker or expo-image-picker for uploads
